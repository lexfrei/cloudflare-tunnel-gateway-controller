# verify-manifest-children.sh — assert a published manifest index was assembled
# out of the images this build job pushed.
#
# The merge job reads its manifest-list digest back from a tag, and ttl.sh has
# no authentication while the run id in that tag is public for as long as the
# run is. In the seconds between the manifest push and the read-back, anyone can
# repoint that tag. The digest read back would then be theirs, and every check
# downstream would accept it, because it really is a well-formed content address
# to a real image. It is just not this build.
#
# What `/tmp/digests` names is not what the published index lists. Provenance is
# on, so each per-arch build pushes an OCI index of its own -- a platform
# manifest plus an attestation manifest -- and `imagetools create` flattens
# index sources, so the published index carries those children and never the
# source digests. Each pushed digest is therefore resolved to its own index, and
# it is that index's children that are compared.
#
# The comparison is equality, not containment. Nothing here constrains the
# `platform` field, and `pull-ci-image.sh` picks what to deploy by platform, so
# an index that keeps all of this job's manifests, relabels the amd64 one and
# puts a foreign manifest in the linux/amd64 slot would satisfy a subset test
# and still hand over a substituted image. Requiring the published set to hold
# nothing else is what closes that. `imagetools create` adds nothing of its own
# to a flattened index -- a real run publishes exactly the union of its sources'
# children -- so equality is what the merge job actually produces.
#
